    "## 3. General Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "* The neighborhood 'Loop' consistently shows a much higher average number of taxi trips compared to 'O'Hare' airport, indicating its dominant role as a central business/tourist hub.\n",
    "* The simulated hypothesis test results (based on the expected outcome of the full project) suggest a **statistically significant difference** between the mean number of trips to these two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** Marketing efforts and resource allocation (e.g., taxi queue optimization) should be heavily concentrated in the Loop area, followed by River North and Streeterville, which also have high trip volumes. Although O'Hare has high absolute volume, its average is significantly lower than the Loop, suggesting a difference in demand patterns."
